		<h2 class="h2">A Backstory</h2>
		<p class="p1">
			Dr. Piccolo was a dentist in Charleston, North Carolina in 1963. He was madly in love with music. At work, he had a Camry CR 1149 player (Doc was well versed in these things). The doctor traveled a lot and collected vinyl records from different countries. He played music to his patients during the procedures and everyone enjoyed the process. Unfortunately, it was difficult to get music records in his city and Mr.Piccolo decided to open his own business. At first it was a small shop <strong>on the corner of Rosemary Street.</strong> Local music connoisseurs came there, young people who wanted to choose tracks for the party, and everyone who was involved in music in one way or another. Soon Mr. Piccolo began to trade in musical instruments. The business prospered, and there were more and more fans of the store. Dr. Piccolo died in 1993, leaving behind a small shop and several thousand people who fell in love with music.
